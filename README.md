# search-engine

The following is an extension of a project completed in Internet and Web Systems taught by Andreas Haeberlen at the University of Pennsylvania.

The project involves building a distributed web system from scratch to create a powerful search engine. This involves designing and implementing all the necessary components, including servers, data storage, and search algorithms, to enable effective web crawling and indexing. We aim to develop a reliable and scalable system that can handle high volumes of data and deliver fast, accurate search results to users.
